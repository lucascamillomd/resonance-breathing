# Resonance Breathing

An iOS & watchOS **resonance breathing app** with real‑time HRV biofeedback, adaptive breathing rate optimization, and Apple Watch haptic guidance.

This app helps users practice coherent respiration by guiding their breath rhythm in sync with heart rate variability (HRV), promoting calm, focused breathing with visual, haptic, and real‑time feedback.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📱 **iOS & watchOS Support**  
  Native Swift app targeting iPhone and Apple Watch.

- 💓 **Real‑Time HRV Biofeedback**  
  Uses live heart rate data to calculate heart rate variability and adapt the breathing rate to maximize coherence.

- 🌬️ **Adaptive Breathing Rate Optimization**  
  Continuously adjusts breathing guidance to help users reach and maintain their optimal resonance frequency.

- 📊 **Visual & Haptic Guidance**  
  Apple Watch haptics accompany on‑screen animations to help users time inhalations and exhalations.

- 🛠 Swift‑based codebase designed for modern Xcode workflows.  
  (No external frameworks required beyond Apple Health + Watch connectivity.)
